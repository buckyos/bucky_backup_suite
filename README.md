## Goal

1. **Develop a `zero-dependency, zero-trust` backup software:**

    - **Zero Dependency:** The software should not rely on the operational status of any centralized service provider. Even if a service provider goes out of business, the data's integrity can still be maintained through pre-established secure backup strategies.
    - **Zero Trust:** The software should not require trust in third-party service providers. Users can store backup data with confidence, ensuring autonomy and control without risking data leakage or loss.

2. **Provide extensibility and compatibility with various storage services:**

    - Developers should be able to easily and quickly extend the software to integrate with various storage service providers.
